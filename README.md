All hands-on DevOps projects

This repository would contain all the hands-on DevOps projects that I have completed as part of learning.

I have completed a handful of projects as part of the DevOps bootcamp that I attended at Tech World with Nana - https://www.techworld-with-nana.com. These projects are housed in Gitlab. Please find below the link to Gitlab where you will find all the projects that I completed as part of the bootcamp with appropriate descriptions in the relevant README.
